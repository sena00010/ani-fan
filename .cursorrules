Before we dive into the best practices, please note that you need to adapt the globs depending on your project's specific file structure and requirements.

name: nextjs-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for Next.js applications and routing
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
---

- Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) to optimize initial load times
- Implement dynamic imports to split and load code on demand, reducing bundle size
- Use `next/headers` and `next/csrf` to protect against XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities
- Implement input validation and sanitization in API routes

name: nodejs-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for Node.js backend development
globs: **/*.{ts,js}
---

- Use `async/await` and `Promise.all` for efficient I/O operations
- For simple backends, use early returns and minimal middleware in `server.js` for better performance
- Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms

name: tailwindcss-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for styling with Tailwind CSS
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,css}

name: react-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for React component development
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}

name: security-best-practices.mdc
description: Security best practices for web applications
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
---

- Implement proper input validation and sanitization in all user inputs

name: project-structure-best-practices.mdc
description: Best practices for organizing project structure
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
---
